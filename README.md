# capstone
For my first capstone project for Springboard's Data Science Career Track, I am using the World Bank's Gender Statistics dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. The set covers data from all regions of the world (populated by humans) and includes statistics on a large number of indicators, including population, birth rate, education, employment, and so on.
